# SFRPG Global Attack
Do you want to not have to ask "did you include Get'Em in that?", "was that against flat-footed AC?", and "did you include cover in that roll?"

Or do you want to change the notes/tooltip on existing modifiers?

This module lets you easily modify, add, and delete the global modifiers available on attack rolls. 

Configuration -> Module Settings -> SFRPG Global Attack -> Edit Global Bonuses.
Changes made in the window that opens will be set to be the modifiers available on all attack rolls. The Reset to Defaults button sets the global modifiers back to the system's default settings.
